ruby_parser

== DESCRIPTION:

ruby_parser (RP) is a ruby parser written in pure ruby (utilizing
racc--which does by default use a C extension). RP's output is
the same as ParseTree's output: s-expressions using ruby's arrays and
base types.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Pure ruby, no compiles.
* Includes preceding comment data for defn/defs/class/module nodes!
* Incredibly simple interface.
* Output is 100% equivalent to ParseTree.
  * Can utilize PT's SexpProcessor and UnifiedRuby for language processing.
* Known Issue: Speed sucks currently. 5500 tests currently run in 21 min.
* Known Issue: Code is waaay ugly. Port of a port. Not my fault. Will fix RSN.
* Known Issue: I don't currently support newline nodes.
* Known Issue: Totally awesome.
* Known Issue: dasgn_curr decls can be out of order from ParseTree's.

== SYNOPSIS:

  RubyParser.new.parse "1+1"
  # => s(:call, s(:lit, 1), :+, s(:array, s(:lit, 1)))

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby. woot.
* ParseTree is needed for Sexp class... crap. I might break that out.
* ParseTree for testing.
* racc full package for parser development.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ruby_parser
